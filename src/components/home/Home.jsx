        <span className="home-text">        Green Lake Pickleball (GLP) is the name we've chosen for the informal 
          group of players who gather for "drop-in" play at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/YsSC3hL1JNjBea8t9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Green Lake East courts</a> located near the Community 
          Center.  GLP is NOT a club; we don't collect dues and we have neither a charter, nor a governance board, nor any formal club officers.  But 
          we do have a mission: <i>to create and sustain a fun, inclusive, and challenging pickleball environment for players of all abilities</i>.  <a href="#player-donations">Player 
          donations</a> support our expenses (<Link to="/courts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">court reservations</Link>, balls, nets, etc.) and your active participation sustains and enriches the 
          unique pickleball community at Green Lake.

        <span className="home-text">        Since you've managed to find our web address, you've probably already seen and experienced the pickleball 
        scene at Green Lake East.  We hope you've enjoyed the fun and challenging play, and, as we slowly build this website (all with volunteer help), 
        we hope you'll find it informative and helpful.  As various links get filled with content, we'll notify you via our <a href="#join-glp">GLP Google group message</a> board.  In 
        the meantime, check back every now and then and enjoy fun play at Green Lake.</span>
